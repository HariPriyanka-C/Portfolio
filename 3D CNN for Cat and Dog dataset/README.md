# **Data Preprocessing for Cats and Dogs Image Dataset**

**Overview**

This repository contains the data preprocessing steps performed on the Cats and Dogs image dataset in preparation for training a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The goal of this project is to classify images into two categories: cats and dogs. Effective data preprocessing is crucial for improving model performance and accuracy.

**Dataset**

The Cats and Dogs dataset consists of 25,000 images of cats and dogs. Each image is labeled accordingly, making it a well-suited dataset for binary classification tasks.

**Preprocessing Steps**

1. Image Resizing
   
Objective: Standardize the size of all input images to ensure uniformity for model training.
Method: Each image was resized to 256x256 pixels using image processing libraries such as OpenCV or PIL.

2. Conversion to Volumes:

Objective: Convert 2D images into 3D volumetric data suitable for training a 3D CNN model.
Method: Stacked 10 images together to form a single volume, allowing the model to learn from spatial relationships across multiple slices.

3. Normalization
   
Objective: Scale pixel values to a range that is suitable for training deep learning models.
Method: Pixel values were normalized to a range of [0, 1] by dividing by 255.0.

4. Data Splitting
   
Objective: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance accurately.

Method:

Training set: 80% of the dataset

Validation set: 10% of the dataset

Test set: 10% of the dataset

5. Label Encoding
   
Objective: Convert categorical labels into a numerical format.

Method: Used one-hot encoding to transform the labels 'cat' and 'dog' into binary vectors.

**Tools and Libraries Used**

Python

TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch, depending on your framework)

OpenCV / PIL

NumPy

Matplotlib (for visualization)

**Conclusion**

The preprocessing steps outlined in this document are essential for preparing the Cats and Dogs dataset for training a 3D CNN model. By resizing images, augmenting the dataset, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the dataset appropriately, we ensure that the model is trained on high-quality, uniform data, ultimately improving its performance in classifying images.
