# **Hari Priyanka's Research Portfolio:**

## **About Me:**

I am Hari Priyanka, a freelance technical trainer and researcher with over 14 years of experience in academia, specializing in computer vision, deep learning, and explainable AI. Currently pursuing a part-time PhD at Annamalai University, my research focuses on applying advanced neural networks like 3D CNNs to medical imaging and volumetric data classification.

I have worked extensively with tools such as PyTorch and Grad-CAM to interpret and improve model performance, and I’m continuously expanding my skillset in areas like self-supervised learning. My goal is to contribute to the field of AI while building a career in remote work, combining my passion for research with practical applications in image processing.

## **Key Projects:**

### **3D CNN for Cat and Dog Classification:**

**Description:** Developed a 3D CNN model to classify volumetric images of cats and dogs, achieving a test accuracy of 81%. Used Grad-CAM to interpret and visualize the features learned by the model.
**Technologies:** PyTorch, NumPy, Grad-CAM, Google Colab


### **Lung CT Scan Classification:**

**Description:** Currently working on a model to classify Lung CT scan images for medical diagnosis, focusing on handling NIfTI formats and volumetric data.
**Technologies:** PyTorch, NIfTI, Medical Imaging, Explainable AI

### **Self-Supervised Learning with Pretext Tasks:**

**Description:** Implemented pretext tasks as part of self-supervised learning to enhance the performance of 3D CNN models. This work demonstrates how self-supervised learning can be effectively used for image classification tasks.
**Technologies:** PyTorch, Python, Self-Supervised Learning
